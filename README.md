Jumble
======

Installation and Development Steps:

1) Install a server locally (recommendation: XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html))
2) Install Git (http://git-scm.com/downloads)
3) Once both are installed, open a command prompt and "cd" into the Document Root of your server (For a default XAMPP install, this will be located at C:\xampp\htdocs)
	For non-XAMPP servers, consult the documentation of your server. Document Root is the folder location that your server serves pages out off.
4) While inside the Document Root of your server, type the following into your command prompt: "git clone https://github.com/tengli01/Jumble.git". This will create a folder called "Jumble" inside your Document Root.
5) To see if everything worked, open a web browser and type the following into the address bar: "localhost/Jumble" and press enter. You should see a page appear saying "Hello World"
